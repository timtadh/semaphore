# Counting Semaphores for Go

by Tim Henderson

## Why?

I was studying for my concurrent algorithms qualifier and I wanted to write my
semaphore solutions in Go. Semaphores are usually the wrong abstraction these
days but I still needed to do the problems. Instead of just letting the code rot
on my filesystem I thought other people might find it useful.
